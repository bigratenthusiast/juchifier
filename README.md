## Installation

### Chrome
Firstly, either build this project, or download it from releases. If you download it make sure to extract the zip folder to a safe location. If you build it, move the `/dist` folder to a safe location, though its probably a good idea to rename it to something you'll remember.

Next, head to [`chrome://extensions`](chrome://extensions) and enable developer mode. Then click `Load Unpacked` and select the folder from the previous step. 

### Firefox
`// TODO`

## Building
Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), then [download this repository](https://github.com/bigratenthusiast/juchifier/archive/refs/heads/main.this repository)

Next, run `npm i` to install the packages and `npm run build:prod` to build. Your extension should be in the `/dist` directory.

## Usage
Gregorian Calendar years will be replaced with their corresponding years from the Juche Calendar.

## Possible Problems
We detect years as any 4 digit number. If you're using this extension on a school laptop (which you probably shouldn't be, all things considered) or any computer where you're going to be dealing with exact numbers, keep that in mind lol
